## Security and Performance Considerations
- Implement proper authentication for SSE connections using JWT tokens
- Optimize message payload size to reduce network overhead
- Implement rate limiting to prevent potential DoS attacks
- Use connection pooling for RabbitMQ to improve performance
- Implement proper error handling and logging for better debugging and monitoring
- Set up automated performance testing as part of the CI/CD pipeline
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for improved fault tolerance

## Testing Strategy
- Implement unit tests for all new and modified components (backend and frontend)
- Aim for at least 80% test coverage for critical components
- Add integration tests for SSE communication flow
- Implement end-to-end tests for the entire notification system using Cypress
- Test various network conditions and error scenarios using network throttling tools
- Perform load testing to ensure system stability under high concurrency (target: 1000 concurrent connections)
- Implement automated performance regression tests

## Logging and Monitoring
- Implement structured logging for easier log analysis
- Set up centralized log management system (e.g., ELK stack)
- Implement real-time monitoring dashboards for SSE performance metrics
- Set up alerts for critical errors and performance degradation

## Scalability Considerations
- Design the system to work in a multi-server environment
- Implement a distributed cache for sharing SSE connection information across servers
- Consider using a message broker (e.g., Apache Kafka) for improved scalability in the future

## Next Steps (Future Considerations)
- Consider implementing WebSocket for real-time bi-directional communication if needed
- Explore using a dedicated message broker (e.g., Apache Kafka) for better scalability
- Implement analytics for monitoring SSE performance and usage
- Consider implementing a circuit breaker pattern for improved fault tolerance
- Explore containerization and orchestration (e.g., Docker and Kubernetes) for easier scaling and management
